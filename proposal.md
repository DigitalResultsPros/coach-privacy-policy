Coach: Proposal

## 1. Problem Statement
People want to improve their lives. They want better habits, clearer goals, someone in their corner. But the options right now are not great.

Human coaches cost $200-500 per month. They are worth it, for some, but most people cannot justify that kind of expense. And even if you can, good luck finding one available at 3am when anxiety has you wide awake.

Generic self-help apps are everywhere. Most of them feel like they were built for nobody in particular. You open the app, get some generic advice, close it, and forget it exists within a week. Nothing sticks because nothing adapts.

AI chatbots are getting better, but they still feel like talking to a stranger every time. They do not remember what you worked through last week. They do not know your goals or your patterns. Every conversation starts from zero.

### The gap is clear:
People need support that is always available, actually remembers them, and adapts to how they work—but they cannot afford the premium price tag of human coaching.
Who this affects:
Busy professionals who want to build better habits but do not have time for weekly coaching sessions. Self-starters who have tried the generic apps and found them lacking. People in transition due to career changes, new parents, or health journeys, who need extra support without extra appointments. Journaling enthusiasts who want their reflections to actually mean something.
The core need is simple: an always-available coach that remembers your context, adapts to your style, and helps you stay consistent. Without the high cost. Without the scheduling. Without starting from scratch every time.

## 2. Solution Overview
Coach is an AI-powered personal development platform that actually gets to know you.

It remembers. Your journal entries become context for future conversations. Your goals shape what the coach focuses on. Your mood patterns inform the advice you get. The more you use it, the more it understands how you work. Every conversation can include your journal contents, or not, it’s up to you.

It adapts. Choose from 25+ coaching voices, each with a distinct personality. Need high energy motivation? There is a voice for that. Want calm, measured guidance through a tough decision? Different voice. Prefer gentle support when things are hard? You have options. Ultra members can even design their own voice using sliders for warmth, directness, energy, structure, and challenge.
It stays. No scheduling appointments. No billable hours. No waiting for your weekly session. Coach is there at 3am when you cannot sleep. It is there on Sunday morning when motivation is low. It is there during your lunch break when you need a quick accountability check.
Everything connects. Goals, habits, check-ins, and journals all tie together. You set a goal, the coach helps break it into steps. You track habits, the dashboard shows your momentum. You write in your journal, the coach references it in your next conversation (at your discretion.) Nothing resets. Nothing lives in isolation.

This is not just another chatbot with a nice interface. It is a system designed to build an actual relationship with your personal growth.

## 3. Monetization Strategy
Three tiers. Simple pricing. Clear value at each level.

#### Free: Real Value, No Commitment
Jump in and start growing. No credit card required.
100 words per message—enough for real conversations
5 journal entries to see how journaling enhances coaching
2 coaching voices to sample different styles
Full access to view dummy screens for all tabs (including Ultra exclusive voices). See what the screens look like: Dashboard, Goals Habits, Voices, Voice Creation, Journal, Profile, and check-ins.
The free tier is not a crippled trial. It is genuinely useful. Users can have meaningful conversations.. The limits exist to guide upgrades, not to block engagement.

### Member: $6.49/month
For people ready to take personal growth seriously.

500 words per message—five times the depth
50 journal entries—build a meaningful history
25 unique coaching voices—find your perfect match
Weekly summaries—progress reports that keep you accountable
Journal-aware coaching—the coach can read your entries and will reference them If you allow it
At $6.49, this costs less than a single therapy session and delivers value all month long. It is priced to be an easy decision for anyone who has used the free tier and hit the limits.


### Ultra: $12.49/month
For power users who want complete control.

2000 words per message—no ceiling on conversation depth
Unlimited journaling—capture everything
Custom voice creation—design your ideal coach with precision sliders
Voice sharing—share your creations with other Ultra members
Priority AI processing—faster responses during peak times
Ultra members are not just buying higher limits. They are building something: custom voices that reflect exactly how they want to be coached. These voices become shareable assets within the Ultra community.

## 4. How It Works
RevenueCat handles subscription management across iOS and Android. Users select a tier, pay through the App Store or Play Store, and get immediate access. Cancellations take effect at the end of the billing period—no tricks, no hidden retention tactics. Data is not preserved or stored.

## 5. Why This Works
The pricing creates a natural progression. Free users hit word limits through normal use exploring the differences between the 2 generic models: Supportive Coach and Direct Coach. They see the Member features and understand exactly what they are missing. Members who want custom voices that they can generate themselves have a clear upgrade path to Ultra.
No hard blocks. No feature gating that prevents exploration. Just gentle limits that encourage engagement and clear value at each price point.

# Summary
Coach fills the gap between expensive human coaching and generic self-help apps. It delivers always-available, context-aware AI coaching that actually remembers users and their personal issues, and adapts to their needs. The three-tier model creates a natural path from exploration to commitment to full customization. RevenueCat handles the subscription complexity so that the focus stays on delivering real value.
